   <p>Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population.<br> India is the second-largest producer of rice, growing it across diverse regions.<br> It is mainly cultivated as a Kharif crop and thrives in hot, humid climates.<br> Rice provides essential carbohydrates and supports rural livelihoods. <br> Its production is vital for food security and agricultural developmen</p>
    <ul class="list1" >
            <li>CO-43 with 6.36%-annual growth rate</li>
            <li>CR1009 with 3.74%-annual growth rate</li>
            <li>ADT-43 with 3.18%-annual growth rate</li>

 <h3>Climate</h3>
 <p>The ideal temperature range is 20°C to 30°C, with an average annual rainfall of 150 cm to 300 cm. Rice thrives in high humidity and requires a consistent water supply</p>
 <h3>Suitable soil types and pH levels</h3>
 <p>Tamil Nadu, the most suitable soil for rice cultivation is clayey loam due to its high water retention capacity. The ideal soil pH for rice generally ranges from  5.5-6.5</p>
</div>
<div class="cards">
    <h3>Sowing</h3>
    <p>The best season for sowing rice in Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu, is during the Samba season, which typically falls between August and September. The specific month can vary slightly depending on the local conditions and variety of rice being planted. For example, in some districts, sowing can start as early as July</p>
<h3>Seed Rate</h3>
<p>a common recommendation is 40 kg per hectare. For direct seeding, the rate may be higher, around 60-80 kg per hectare according to the TNAU Agritech Portal. </p>
<h3>Spacing</h3>
<p>In transplanting, the spacing between rows and plants is crucial for optimal growth. A common spacing is 20 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants according to the TNAU Agritech Portal. In direct seeding, spacing may vary depending on the method (e.g., line sowing, drum seeder)</p>
<h3></h3>
<ul  class="list">
    <li>The germination time for rice seeds typically ranges from 3 to 7 days after sowing, depending on temperature and moisture levels.</li>
    <li>Optimal temperatures for germination are between 25-30°C</li>
    <li>Lower temperatures (below 10°C) and higher temperatures (above 40°C) can hinder germination according to the JICA handbook.</li>
    <li>Sufficient moisture is essential for seed imbibition (absorption of water) which triggers germination</li>

</ul>
<h3>Nursery</h3>
<p>Water should be drained 18-24 hours after sowing, and stagnation should be avoided. From the 3rd to 5th day, allow enough water to saturate the soil, then maintain a 2.5 cm depth. </p>
<h3>Transplanted Rice</h3>
<p>should be applied to a depth of 2.5-5 cm, one day after the disappearance of ponded water. </p> 
<h3>Semi-dry Rice</h3>
<p>Irrigation should begin 30-35 days after sowing, with water depths of 2.5-5.0 cm. Follow the schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water. </p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>A general guideline is to provide approximately 10mm of water per day, adjusted based on the crop's maturity duration. </p>

<div class="cards">
<h3>Fertilizer Application:</h3>
<h3>Soil Analysis</h3>
<p>Soil testing is recommended to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and appropriate fertilizer requirements for the rice crop. </p>
<h3>Organic Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Organic matter, such as farmyard manure or compost, can be incorporated into the soil before planting to improve soil fertility and structure, according to a ScienceDirect.com article. </p>

<h3>Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
<ul>
<li>NPK Fertilizers: A common recommendation is 15-20 kg N, 40-60 kg P2O5, 20 kg K2O, and 20 kg S per hectare according to the National Food Security Mission (NFSM).</li>
<li>Micronutrients: Zinc sulfate (15 kg/ha), borax (10 kg/ha), sodium molybdate (1 kg/ha), and iron (1 kg/ha) can be beneficial for optimal growth and yield.</li> 
<li>Urea: Urea can be applied in split doses: basal dose, and at 30 and 60 days after sowing. </li>
<li>DAP and MOP: Diammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MOP) can also be used as basal fertilizer applications. </li></ul>

<h3>Fertigation:</h3>
<p>In some cases, fertilizers can be applied through irrigation water (fertigation), especially for nitrogen and potassium. </p>
<h3>Bio-fertilizers</h3>
<p>Using phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) can enhance phosphorus availability in the soil. </p>
<h3> NPK 19:19:19</h3> 
<p>This water-soluble fertilizer can be used in drip irrigation (1.5-2 grams per liter of water) or as a foliar spray (0.5-1.0% concentration). </p>
Considerations</p>
<h3>Water Use Efficiency</h3>
<p>Optimizing irrigation and fertilization can significantly impact water use efficiency, especially in water-scarce regions. </p>
<h3>Crop Stages</h3>
<p>Fertilizer application should be tailored to the different growth stages of the rice plant (e.g., seedling, tillering, flowering, and ripening). </p>

<div class="cards">
    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
    <p>Rice is ready for harvest when the majority of grains are straw-colored, hard, and fully developed, typically 30-35 days after flowering. Harvesting involves reaping, threshing, cleaning, and drying the grains. The time to maturity varies by variety, but generally ranges from 110-136 days after sowing</p>
