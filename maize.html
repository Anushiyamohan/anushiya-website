<div>
       <p>Maize is one of the most important cereal crops in India<br> with several major varieties cultivated across different regions.<br> The annual growth in maize production has shown a consistent upward trend,<br> driven by improved hybrid varieties, better farming practices,<br> and increased demand for food, fodder, and industrial use.</p>
   <ul class="list1" >
            <li>CP818 with 7.98%-annual growth rate</li>
            <li>NK 6240 with 7.14%-annual growth rate</li>
            <li>CP808 with 5.92%-annual growth rate</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

 <h3>Climate</h3>
 <p>Maize thrives in warm climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained, fertile soil. Ideal temperatures range from 60-86°F (15-30°C) during the day and around 14°C at night, with at least 140 frost-free days. Suitable soil types include well-drained sandy loam to silty loam, with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. </p>
 <h3>Suitable soil types and pH levels</h3>
 <p>Maize thrives in well-drained sandy loam to silty loam soils. The optimal pH range for maize is between 5.5 and 7.5, with slightly acidic to neutral soils being ideal. Proper drainage is crucial, as waterlogging can negatively impact the crop</p>
</div>
<div class="cards">
    <h3>Sowing</h3>
    <p>The best season for sowing maize depends on the region and whether it's a rainfed or irrigated crop. Generally, June-July or August-September are the best sowing times for rainfed maize, while January-February is suitable for irrigated crops. In southern India, maize can be sown anytime from April to October</p>
<h3>Seed Rate</h3>
<p>The seed rate for maize typically ranges from 17 to 25 kg per hectare. For Rabi maize, a rate of 20-22 kg per hectare is recommended to achieve a plant population of 85-90 thousand plants. Specific seed rates may vary based on the maize variety and desired plant population </p>
<h3>Spacing</h3>
<p>For optimal maize yield, a common spacing recommendation is to plant seeds with a row-to-row spacing of 60 cm (2 feet) and a plant-to-plant spacing of 20-25 cm (8-10 inches). This spacing generally results in a plant population of around 60,000 to 66,000 plants per hectare</p>
<h3>Germination</h3>
<ul  class="list">
    <li>Maize (corn) seeds typically germinate in 4 to 10 days. The optimal temperature for germination is around 29-32°C (84-90°F), where they may emerge in 4-5 days.</li>
    <li>Normal or Average Conditions (18-25°C or 64-77°F): Germination times typically fall within the 5-10 day range</li>
    <li>Optimal Conditions (29-32°C or 84-90°F): Maize seeds germinate relatively quickly, with emergence often occurring within 4-5 days.</li>
    <li>Optimal Conditions (29-32°C or 84-90°F): Maize seeds germinate relatively quickly, with emergence often occurring within 4-5 days.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Nursery</h3>
<p>Nursery preparation for maize involves creating a suitable seedbed, selecting quality seeds, and ensuring proper sowing and watering. Key steps include land preparation, seed treatment, and managing water and crop protection. Well-prepared nurseries are crucial for healthy seedling establishment and ultimately, higher maize yields </p>
<h3>Transplanted Maize</h3>
<p>Transplanting maize involves growing seedlings in a nursery and then transferring them to the main field. This technique can lead to higher yields, better crop stands, and potentially a shorter overall growth period compared to direct seeding. Transplanting is particularly useful when direct seeding is challenging due to factors like unpredictable rainfall or pest damage to seedlings </p> 
<h3>Semi-dry Maize</h3>
<p>Semi-dry maize, also known as maize silage, is a method of preserving green maize forage for livestock feed. It involves fermenting chopped green maize in a silo, similar to the sauerkraut process. This method is popular in regions where maize cultivation is possible but where drying the maize for grain is difficult due to climatic conditions </p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Maize (corn) cultivation requires warm and moist conditions, thriving in temperatures between 21°C and 30°C. Well-drained, fertile soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 are ideal. Proper soil management and fertilization are crucial, with nitrogen and phosphorus being the most important nutrients. </p>
</div>
<div class="cards">
<h3>Fertilizer Application:</h3>
<h3>Soil Analysis</h3>
<p>Soil testing is recommended to determine the specific nutrient deficiencies and appropriate fertilizer requirements for the Maize crop. </p>
<h3>Organic Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Organic matter, such as farmyard manure or compost, can be incorporated into the soil before planting to improve soil fertility and structure, according to a ScienceDirect.com article. </p>

<h3>Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
<ul>
<li>NPK Fertilizers: Commonly used, with different ratios depending on the specific needs of the maize crop and soil conditions. For example, an NPK 15:15:15 fertilizer is often used.</li>
<li>Urea: A nitrogen-rich fertilizer, often applied in split doses during the growing season.</li> 
<li>Superphosphate & Potassium Chloride: Used as basal fertilizers to provide phosphorus and potassium </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="cards">
<h3>Fertigation:</h3>
<p>Fertigation in maize involves applying fertilizers along with irrigation water, typically through drip irrigation or sprinkler systems. This method allows for precise and efficient nutrient delivery, potentially increasing yields and resource use efficiency. </p>
<h3>Bio-fertilizers</h3>
<p>Rhizobium,Azotobacter,Pseudomonas,Bacillus and Trichoderma </p>
</div>
<div class="cards">
    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
    <p>Maize harvesting involves identifying the optimal time based on crop maturity, followed by manual or mechanical removal of the cobs, drying, and threshing. Harvesting at the right time, when the kernels are mature and the moisture content is suitable (around 12-15% for storage), ensures good quality and minimizes lossess.</p>
